Step 1 Facial Cleansers Step 2 Treatment Step 3 Facial Moisturizers Step 4 Sunscreen Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Need more knowledge about Eczema? According to the National Eczema Association (NEA), eczema affects approximately 31.6 million Americans. 1 This common skin condition causes a red, itchy rash that’s often accompanied by dryness , flaking, rough skin , or irritation. Fortunately, a daily skincare routine with gentle cleansers, moisturizers , and over-the-counter (OTC) eczema treatments may help relieve itchy skin and improve the appearance of eczema flare-ups. Developed with dermatologists , CeraVe’s range of eczema products provide hydrating and soothing effects that can help support comfortable, healthier-looking skin. They contain three essential ceramides and are formulated to help restore the skin’s protective barrier. Our Eczema Relief Cream y Oil and Hydrocortisone Anti-Itch Cream are fragrance-free , gentle on your skin, and accepted by the National Eczema Association. Discover CeraVe Products for Eczema-Prone Skin Frequently Asked Questions The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) describes eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis ) as a complex skin condition that’s caused by an interaction between an individual’s environment and their genes. 1,2 Although the exact cause is yet to be determined, people with eczema are generally believed to have an overactive immune system. This may cause the skin to become inflamed when it comes into contact with irritants or allergens (which can include some fragrance s ). According to the National Eczema Association , eczema may be linked to chronic skin barrier dysfunction, where the skin’s protective barrier isn’t able to effectively retain moisture and filter out environmental toxins. 3 Signs of eczema can vary from person to person. Eczema rashes may also vary in color based on your skin tone, so it’s essential to consult a board-certified dermatologist if you suspect your skin issues may be caused by eczema. In general, eczema tends to appear in cycles (known as “flare-ups”) that show up as a dry, red rash accompanied by itching, sensitivity , and irritation. According to the Mayo Clinic , the severity of eczema rashes can range from mild to severe, with some people even experiencing blisters, bumps , thick patches of skin, swelling, and scaly or crusty skin. 4 Eczema tends to be common during early childhood but can occur at any age. It’s typically believed to be triggered by allergens or irritants in your environment. According to the National Eczema Association , these triggers may include stress levels, having very dry skin , food allergies, harsh weather, and certain cleansers or shampoos. The NEA also states that some people may have a genetic predisposition that can make them more likely to experience eczema. 1 People with lighter skin tones may notice visibly dry, red or pink rashes on their skin, whereas those with deeper skin tones may experience dry-looking patches that appear brown, purple, or gray. Although eczema rashes can appear anywhere on your body, research shows that eczema is likely to affect the insides of the elbows, backs of the knees, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. 5 Eczema is sometimes mistaken for psoriasis (another dry, itchy skin condition), so it’s important to remember that only your doctor or a board-certified dermatologist can assess your skin and make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor or dermatologist can offer personalized guidance on the best ways to care for your eczema-prone skin. With that said, the National Eczema Association recommends avoiding potential triggers and focus on managing eczema symptoms with gentle skincare products . 6 This includes applying sunscreen daily, avoiding products with fragrance, and using moisturizers that are designed to help restore the skin barrier. 7,8 In some cases, your dermatologist may recommend an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream for eczema (such as CeraVe Hydrocortisone Anti-Itch Cream ) or a prescription treatment. It can also be helpful to apply a fragrance-free moisturizer on damp skin immediately after bathing to help trap moisture and reduce dryness. There are several skincare ingredients that may be helpful for those with eczema-prone skin. The National Eczema Association suggests looking for products that contain humectants (such as hyaluronic acid ), which attract moisture to the skin’s outer layer, as well as niacinamide , glycerin, petrolatum , vitamin E, and oat or shea butter. 7 You may also want to look for skin barrier creams that contain ceramides , which are a key component of your skin’s natural protective barrier. Many creams for eczema (such as Ce",

If you are dealing with visible redness, cracked, or dry skin , you may benefit from incorporating products that are formulated to soothe skin sensitivity into your skincare routine.

Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Important Things to Know about Sensitive Skin The key to addressing the needs of sensitive skin is first to find out the cause of your skin sensitivity. A board-certified dermatologist can help you determine the root cause of your hypersensitivity and develop a gentle and effective skincare routine. No matter the cause of your sensitive skin, it is always a good idea to stay away from skincare products with fragrances—and other irritants, like alcohol—and rely on products that hydrate and protect your skin barrier. Sensitive skin is a skin type characterized by skin hypersensitivity often caused by cosmetics, skincare products, and specific climate conditions. It is possible to have more than one skin type, so your skin can be oily, dry, or combination, as well as sensitive. If you experience skin irritation on your face or body—such as red bumps, dryness, redness, or cracked skin after applying cosmetics or skincare products—or after being exposed to certain environmental conditions, you likely have sensitive skin. 1 For further guidance, always be sure to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. While sensitive skin is a common skincare concern, there is not much known about the underlying causes of skin sensitivity. If you want to learn more about what is causing your sensitive skin, we recommend scheduling an appointment with a board-certified dermatologist. 1.

Discover CeraVe Products for Eczema-Prone Skin Frequently Asked Questions The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) describes eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis ) as a complex skin condition that’s caused by an interaction between an individual’s environment and their genes. 1,2 Although the exact cause is yet to be determined, people with eczema are generally believed to have an overactive immune system. This may cause the skin to become inflamed when it comes into contact with irritants or allergens (which can include some fragrance s ). According to the National Eczema Association , eczema may be linked to chronic skin barrier dysfunction, where the skin’s protective barrier isn’t able to effectively retain moisture and filter out environmental toxins. 3 Signs of eczema can vary from person to person. Eczema rashes may also vary in color based on your skin tone, so it’s essential to consult a board-certified dermatologist if you suspect your skin issues may be caused by eczema. In general, eczema tends to appear in cycles (known as “flare-ups”) that show up as a dry, red rash accompanied by itching, sensitivity , and irritation. According to the Mayo Clinic , the severity of eczema rashes can range from mild to severe, with some people even experiencing blisters, bumps , thick patches of skin, swelling, and scaly or crusty skin. 4 Eczema tends to be common during early childhood but can occur at any age. It’s typically believed to be triggered by allergens or irritants in your environment. According to the National Eczema Association , these triggers may include stress levels, having very dry skin , food allergies, harsh weather, and certain cleansers or shampoos. The NEA also states that some people may have a genetic predisposition that can make them more likely to experience eczema. 1 People with lighter skin tones may notice visibly dry, red or pink rashes on their skin, whereas those with deeper skin tones may experience dry-looking patches that appear brown, purple, or gray. Although eczema rashes can appear anywhere on your body, research shows that eczema is likely to affect the insides of the elbows, backs of the knees, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. 5 Eczema is sometimes mistaken for psoriasis (another dry, itchy skin condition), so it’s important to remember that only your doctor or a board-certified dermatologist can assess your skin and make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor or dermatologist can offer personalized guidance on the best ways to care for your eczema-prone skin. With that said, the National Eczema Association recommends avoiding potential triggers and focus on managing eczema symptoms with gentle skincare products . 6 This includes applying sunscreen daily, avoiding products with fragrance, and using moisturizers that are designed to help restore the skin barrier. 7,8 In some cases, your dermatologist may recommend an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream for eczema (such as CeraVe Hydrocortisone Anti-Itch Cream ) or a prescription treatment. It can also be helpful to apply a fragrance-free moisturizer on damp skin immediately after bathing to help trap moisture and reduce dryness. There are several skincare ingredients that may be helpful for those with eczema-prone skin. The National Eczema Association suggests looking for products that contain humectants (such as hyaluronic acid ), which attract moisture to the skin’s outer layer, as well as niacinamide , glycerin, petrolatum , vitamin E, and oat or shea butter. 7 You may also want to look for skin barrier creams that contain ceramides , which are a key component of your skin’s natural protective barrier. Many creams for eczema (such as Ce",

If you are dealing with visible redness, cracked, or dry skin , you may benefit from incorporating products that are formulated to soothe skin sensitivity into your skincare routine.

Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Important Things to Know about Sensitive Skin The key to addressing the needs of sensitive skin is first to find out the cause of your skin sensitivity. A board-certified dermatologist can help you determine the root cause of your hypersensitivity and develop a gentle and effective skincare routine. No matter the cause of your sensitive skin, it is always a good idea to stay away from skincare products with fragrances—and other irritants, like alcohol—and rely on products that hydrate and protect your skin barrier. Sensitive skin is a skin type characterized by skin hypersensitivity often caused by cosmetics, skincare products, and specific climate conditions. It is possible to have more than one skin type, so your skin can be oily, dry, or combination, as well as sensitive. If you experience skin irritation on your face or body—such as red bumps, dryness, redness, or cracked skin after applying cosmetics or skincare products—or after being exposed to certain environmental conditions, you likely have sensitive skin. 1 For further guidance, always be sure to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. While sensitive skin is a common skincare concern, there is not much known about the underlying causes of skin sensitivity. If you want to learn more about what is causing your sensitive skin, we recommend scheduling an appointment with a board-certified dermatologist. 1.

According to the National Eczema Association (NEA), eczema affects approximately 31.6 million Americans. 1 This common skin condition causes a red, itchy rash that’s often accompanied by dryness , flaking, rough skin , or irritation. Fortunately, a daily skincare routine with gentle cleansers, moisturizers , and over-the-counter (OTC) eczema treatments may help relieve itchy skin and improve the appearance of eczema flare-ups. Developed with dermatologists , CeraVe’s range of eczema products provide hydrating and soothing effects that can help support comfortable, healthier-looking skin. They contain three essential ceramides and are formulated to help restore the skin’s protective barrier. Our Eczema Relief Cream y Oil and Hydrocortisone Anti-Itch Cream are fragrance-free , gentle on your skin, and accepted by the National Eczema Association. Discover CeraVe Products for Eczema-Prone Skin Frequently Asked Questions The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) describes eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis ) as a complex skin condition that’s caused by an interaction between an individual’s environment and their genes. 1,2 Although the exact cause is yet to be determined, people with eczema are generally believed to have an overactive immune system. This may cause the skin to become inflamed when it comes into contact with irritants or allergens (which can include some fragrance s ). According to the National Eczema Association , eczema may be linked to chronic skin barrier dysfunction, where the skin’s protective barrier isn’t able to effectively retain moisture and filter out environmental toxins. 3 Signs of eczema can vary from person to person. Eczema rashes may also vary in color based on your skin tone, so it’s essential to consult a board-certified dermatologist if you suspect your skin issues may be caused by eczema. In general, eczema tends to appear in cycles (known as “flare-ups”) that show up as a dry, red rash accompanied by itching, sensitivity , and irritation. According to the Mayo Clinic , the severity of eczema rashes can range from mild to severe, with some people even experiencing blisters, bumps , thick patches of skin, swelling, and scaly or crusty skin. 4 Eczema tends to be common during early childhood but can occur at any age. It’s typically believed to be triggered by allergens or irritants in your environment. According to the National Eczema Association , these triggers may include stress levels, having very dry skin , food allergies, harsh weather, and certain cleansers or shampoos. The NEA also states that some people may have a genetic predisposition that can make them more likely to experience eczema. 1 People with lighter skin tones may notice visibly dry, red or pink rashes on their skin, whereas those with deeper skin tones may experience dry-looking patches that appear brown, purple, or gray. Although eczema rashes can appear anywhere on your body, research shows that eczema is likely to affect the insides of the elbows, backs of the knees, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. 5 Eczema is sometimes mistaken for psoriasis (another dry, itchy skin condition), so it’s important to remember that only your doctor or a board-certified dermatologist can assess your skin and make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor or dermatologist can offer personalized guidance on the best ways to care for your eczema-prone skin. With that said, the National Eczema Association recommends avoiding potential triggers and focus on managing eczema symptoms with gentle skincare products . 6 This includes applying sunscreen daily, avoiding products with fragrance, and using moisturizers that are designed to help restore the skin barrier. 7,8 In some cases, your dermatologist may recommend an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream for eczema (such as CeraVe Hydrocortisone Anti-Itch Cream ) or a prescription treatment. It can also be helpful to apply a fragrance-free moisturizer on damp skin immediately after bathing to help trap moisture and reduce dryness. There are several skincare ingredients that may be helpful for those with eczema-prone skin. The National Eczema Association suggests looking for products that contain humectants (such as hyaluronic acid ), which attract moisture to the skin’s outer layer, as well as niacinamide , glycerin, petrolatum , vitamin E, and oat or shea butter. 7 You may also want to look for skin barrier creams that contain ceramides , which are a key component of your skin’s natural protective barrier. Many creams for eczema (such as Ce",

A board-certified dermatologist can help you determine the root cause of your hypersensitivity and develop a gentle and effective skincare routine. No matter the cause of your sensitive skin, it is always a good idea to stay away from skincare products with fragrances—and other irritants, like alcohol—and rely on products that hydrate and protect your skin barrier. Sensitive skin is a skin type characterized by skin hypersensitivity often caused by cosmetics, skincare products, and specific climate conditions. It is possible to have more than one skin type, so your skin can be oily, dry, or combination, as well as sensitive. If you experience skin irritation on your face or body—such as red bumps, dryness, redness, or cracked skin after applying cosmetics or skincare products—or after being exposed to certain environmental conditions, you likely have sensitive skin. 1 For further guidance, always be sure to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. While sensitive skin is a common skincare concern, there is not much known about the underlying causes of skin sensitivity. If you want to learn more about what is causing your sensitive skin, we recommend scheduling an appointment with a board-certified dermatologist. 1.
