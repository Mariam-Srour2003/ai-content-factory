        "content": "Microsoft’s AI chatbot Copilot will no longer be available on WhatsApp after January 15, the company has shared. After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the web . The company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month . At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI , Perplexity , and others. OpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January. Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.",

        "content": "A year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless. The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Image Credits: Uber/WeRide Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.

Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen , Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a premium robotaxi service using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving system from San Francisco-based startup Nuro. These deals are finally beginning to materialize into commercial services. For instance, Uber and Waymo launched a robotaxi service earlier this year in Austin. Now, Uber has expanded to the Middle East with WeRide in Abu Dhabi — with even more cities to come, including Dubai. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi forecast in the company’s third-quarter earnings report that there would be autonomous vehicle deployments on the Uber network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Uber and WeRide have previously shared plans to expand to 15 cities throughout the Middle East and Europe, eventually scaling to thousands of robotaxis. That would represent a massive leap for WeRide, which today has more than 150 robotaxis in the region.",

        "content": "Spotify is planning to raise subscription prices in the U.S. in the first quarter of next year, according to a new report from the Financial Times . The move will mark the streaming service’s first price rise in the U.S. since July 2024 . The company recently raised prices in several other countries, including the U.K., Switzerland, and Australia. A Spotify subscription currently costs $11.99 a month in the U.S. When the service first launched in the country 14 years ago, it cost $9.99 per month. The report says JPMorgan analysts have estimated that a $1-per-month price increase in the U.S. could increase Spotify’s annual revenue by about $500 million. Additionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix. The report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO . The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, the current co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.",

Follow Follow See All by Lauren Goode Dec 21, 2016, 2:01 PM UTC Link Share Vjeran Pavic The hair-and-makeup tax is a real thing. It might be difficult to fully grasp the amount of time it takes people with long hair, or people who feel a whole lot better with a little bit of makeup on, to get ready to head out the door if you fall into neither category, but trust me: it takes time away from other things you’d rather be doing. So when Dyson said earlier this year that it had reinvented the hair dryer, building one with a powerful 13-blade motor, high-velocity airstream, and temperature control, I took the bait. Tech! Of course new tech would fix the problem. I’ll be honest, I was hesitant to even write about it for The Verge because I assumed most of our audience wouldn’t share the same enthusiasm, but the promise of this hair dryer was too great: with the Supersonic, my morning routine would be expedited; my hair would be flawless; hell, even my bathroom sink would be less cluttered. Right? Right? Reality came fast — faster than you can say “makeup tax,” when I learned that the Supersonic cost $400. The Toyota Corolla of hair dryers this is not; it is more like a Tesla, fast and sleek and also out of my price range. I’ve spent the past couple weeks comparing my standard, $21 Conair with this new Supersonic, and I’ve determined that Dyson’s version of the hair dryer is completely covetable. But still: that’s a lot of money to pay for dry hair. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Dyson is known for its vacuums, and while a vacuum isn’t exactly something you’d envision putting close to your head, Dyson has borrowed technology from its modern vacuums and put it in this hair dryer. Specifically, the hair dryer has been built with Dyson’s “digital motor” technology, which is a brushless, direct current motor that is supposed to suffer less wear and tear over time. Dyson also says the motor spins at 110,000 revolutions per minute compared with 20,000 to 30,000 RPM for standard hair dryers. The Dyson Supersonic is the Tesla of hair dryers That’s some of the technical jargon behind the product, but what it means for practical purposes is that the motor is a tiny, 1-inch-wide thing that fits in the handle of the hair dryer rather than in the nozzle. The result is a light, 1.8-pound hair dryer with evenly distributed weight. When you hold the Dyson in one hand and a “regular” hair dryer in the other, you get a sense of how top-heavy other models are when compared to the Dyson. And when you’re using it for several consecutive minutes, you do start to appreciate this weight distribution. The internals also inform the aesthetics of the product. The plastic head of the Dyson is an open-ended sphere rather than an elongated nozzle with a filter on the backend. There are exactly four buttons on the back of the hair dryer: a power button, a cool air button, heat settings, and air-flow control. The air and heat levels appear in a series of LED lights along the barrel. The filter, which is on the handle, has the word “Filtre” etched on it (I assumed this was because Dyson is a British company, but “filtre” is ... French). The design is undeniably elegant. As one hair stylist remarked when I asked him whether he had been using the Dyson in his salon, it looks like the kind of hair dryer that “those people with ‘Dwell’ homes would have.” Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge But as with most new gadgets, what it can <em>do</em> is more important than its looks. Over the past two weeks I ran a series of tests with both the 1600-watt Dyson Supersonic and the Conair 1875-watt Turbo Style, which I picked up at my local drugstore for a mere $21. Starting with towel-dried hair and a spritz of heat protectant product, I timed how long it took to go from wet hair to dry — no elaborate styling, just some brushing and head-flipping. First off: the Dyson Supersonic is not as quiet as you might think. There’s no doubt the whir of the high-tech hair dryer comes in at a different pitch than the blustery Conair, but it’s not like you’re safe from waking your sleeping roommate with the Dyson. It costs $400 and didn’t dry my hair that much faster than a $21 Conair did But the biggest surprise was that the Dyson didn’t dry my hair in significantly less time than the Conair did. Both dryers took somewhere between f",

        "content": "$6 Fake iPhone Pocket Already Available Wednesday November 26, 2025 6:20 am PST by Hartley Charlton Days after Apple's iPhone Pocket sold out around the world, fake versions of the accessory have started to become available online. Earlier this month, Apple introduced the ‌iPhone‌ Pocket in collaboration with Japanese fashion brand ISSEY MIYAKE. The 3D-knitted limited edition accessory is designed to carry an ‌iPhone‌. The accessory is like a stretchy pocket, not unlike an iPod Sock, but elongated to form a strap made of a ribbed, elastic textile that fully encloses an ‌iPhone‌ yet allows you to glimpse the display through its open structure. It comes in a short strap variant for $149.95 and a long strap variant for $229.95. The ‌iPhone‌ Pocket became available to order on Apple's online store starting Friday, November 14, in the United States, France, China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. It quickly sold out around the world. Now, lookalike versions of the accessories have started to become available on Chinese sites like AliExpress , where you can buy an ‌iPhone‌ Pocket clone for as little as $6 . Some listings describe it as a 1:1 replica, but there is no ISSEY MIYAKE print on the label. They describe the accessory as being made with the same production processes. Both the short and long variants are available in all of the original color options. Apple products and accessories are often replicated by manufacturers in China, but the turnaround for these particular copies has been especially fast. As with most reproductions, quality can vary, yet for customers who missed out on the limited-edition release, found it too expensive, or simply like the aesthetic, the dramatically lower price of these lookalikes may make them a tempting alternative.

        "content": "Microsoft’s AI chatbot Copilot will no longer be available on WhatsApp after January 15, the company has shared. After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the web . The company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month . At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI , Perplexity , and others. OpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January. Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.",

        "content": "$6 Fake iPhone Pocket Already Available Wednesday November 26, 2025 6:20 am PST by Hartley Charlton Days after Apple's iPhone Pocket sold out around the world, fake versions of the accessory have started to become available online. Earlier this month, Apple introduced the ‌iPhone‌ Pocket in collaboration with Japanese fashion brand ISSEY MIYAKE. The 3D-knitted limited edition accessory is designed to carry an ‌iPhone‌. The accessory is like a stretchy pocket, not unlike an iPod Sock, but elongated to form a strap made of a ribbed, elastic textile that fully encloses an ‌iPhone‌ yet allows you to glimpse the display through its open structure. It comes in a short strap variant for $149.95 and a long strap variant for $229.95. The ‌iPhone‌ Pocket became available to order on Apple's online store starting Friday, November 14, in the United States, France, China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. It quickly sold out around the world. Now, lookalike versions of the accessories have started to become available on Chinese sites like AliExpress , where you can buy an ‌iPhone‌ Pocket clone for as little as $6 . Some listings describe it as a 1:1 replica, but there is no ISSEY MIYAKE print on the label. They describe the accessory as being made with the same production processes. Both the short and long variants are available in all of the original color options. Apple products and accessories are often replicated by manufacturers in China, but the turnaround for these particular copies has been especially fast. As with most reproductions, quality can vary, yet for customers who missed out on the limited-edition release, found it too expensive, or simply like the aesthetic, the dramatically lower price of these lookalikes may make them a tempting alternative.

        "content": "Spotify is planning to raise subscription prices in the U.S. in the first quarter of next year, according to a new report from the Financial Times . The move will mark the streaming service’s first price rise in the U.S. since July 2024 . The company recently raised prices in several other countries, including the U.K., Switzerland, and Australia. A Spotify subscription currently costs $11.99 a month in the U.S. When the service first launched in the country 14 years ago, it cost $9.99 per month. The report says JPMorgan analysts have estimated that a $1-per-month price increase in the U.S. could increase Spotify’s annual revenue by about $500 million. Additionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix. The report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO . The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, the current co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.",

Follow Follow See All Tech Dyson’s new Supersonic is the Tesla of hair dryers I want one, but I won’t buy one by Lauren Goode Close Lauren Goode Last published Mar 29, 2018 Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. Follow Follow See All by Lauren Goode Dec 21, 2016, 2:01 PM UTC Link Share Vjeran Pavic The hair-and-makeup tax is a real thing. It might be difficult to fully grasp the amount of time it takes people with long hair, or people who feel a whole lot better with a little bit of makeup on, to get ready to head out the door if you fall into neither category, but trust me: it takes time away from other things you’d rather be doing. So when Dyson said earlier this year that it had reinvented the hair dryer, building one with a powerful 13-blade motor, high-velocity airstream, and temperature control, I took the bait. Tech! Of course new tech would fix the problem. I’ll be honest, I was hesitant to even write about it for The Verge because I assumed most of our audience wouldn’t share the same enthusiasm, but the promise of this hair dryer was too great: with the Supersonic, my morning routine would be expedited; my hair would be flawless; hell, even my bathroom sink would be less cluttered. Right? Right? Reality came fast — faster than you can say “makeup tax,” when I learned that the Supersonic cost $400. The Toyota Corolla of hair dryers this is not; it is more like a Tesla, fast and sleek and also out of my price range. I’ve spent the past couple weeks comparing my standard, $21 Conair with this new Supersonic, and I’ve determined that Dyson’s version of the hair dryer is completely covetable. But still: that’s a lot of money to pay for dry hair. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Dyson is known for its vacuums, and while a vacuum isn’t exactly something you’d envision putting close to your head, Dyson has borrowed technology from its modern vacuums and put it in this hair dryer. Specifically, the hair dryer has been built with Dyson’s “digital motor” technology, which is a brushless, direct current motor that is supposed to suffer less wear and tear over time. Dyson also says the motor spins at 110,000 revolutions per minute compared with 20,000 to 30,000 RPM for standard hair dryers. The Dyson Supersonic is the Tesla of hair dryers That’s some of the technical jargon behind the product, but what it means for practical purposes is that the motor is a tiny, 1-inch-wide thing that fits in the handle of the hair dryer rather than in the nozzle. The result is a light, 1.8-pound hair dryer with evenly distributed weight. When you hold the Dyson in one hand and a “regular” hair dryer in the other, you get a sense of how top-heavy other models are when compared to the Dyson. And when you’re using it for several consecutive minutes, you do start to appreciate this weight distribution. The internals also inform the aesthetics of the product. The plastic head of the Dyson is an open-ended sphere rather than an elongated nozzle with a filter on the backend. There are exactly four buttons on the back of the hair dryer: a power button, a cool air button, heat settings, and air-flow control. The air and heat levels appear in a series of LED lights along the barrel. The filter, which is on the handle, has the word “Filtre” etched on it (I assumed this was because Dyson is a British company, but “filtre” is ... French). The design is undeniably elegant. As one hair stylist remarked when I asked him whether he had been using the Dyson in his salon, it looks like the kind of hair dryer that “those people with ‘Dwell’ homes would have.” Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge But as with most new gadgets, what it can <em>do</em> is more important than its looks. Over the past two weeks I ran a series of tests with both the 1600-watt Dyson Supersonic and the Conair 1875-watt Turbo Style, which I picked up at my local drugstore for a mere $21. Starting with towel-dried hair and a spritz of heat protectant product, I timed how long it took to go from wet hair to dry — no elaborate styling, just some brushing and head-flipping. First off: the Dyson Supersonic is not as quiet as you might think. There’s no doubt the whir of the high-tech hair dryer comes in at a different pitch than the blustery Conair, but it’s not like you’re safe from waking your sleeping roommate with the Dyson. It costs $400 and didn’t dry my hair that much faster than a $21 Conair did But the biggest surprise was that the Dyson didn’t dry my hair in significantly less time than the Conair did. Both dryers took somewhere between f",

        "content": "A year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless. The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Image Credits: Uber/WeRide Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.

Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen , Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a premium robotaxi service using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving system from San Francisco-based startup Nuro. These deals are finally beginning to materialize into commercial services. For instance, Uber and Waymo launched a robotaxi service earlier this year in Austin. Now, Uber has expanded to the Middle East with WeRide in Abu Dhabi — with even more cities to come, including Dubai. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi forecast in the company’s third-quarter earnings report that there would be autonomous vehicle deployments on the Uber network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Uber and WeRide have previously shared plans to expand to 15 cities throughout the Middle East and Europe, eventually scaling to thousands of robotaxis. That would represent a massive leap for WeRide, which today has more than 150 robotaxis in the region.",

            "title": "Microsoft's AI chatbot Copilot leaves WhatsApp on January 15 | TechCrunch",
            "content": "Microsoft’s AI chatbot Copilot will no longer be available on WhatsApp after January 15, the company has shared. After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the web . The company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month . At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI , Perplexity , and others. OpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January. Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.",

The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Image Credits: Uber/WeRide Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.

Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen , Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a premium robotaxi service using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving system from San Francisco-based startup Nuro. These deals are finally beginning to materialize into commercial services. For instance, Uber and Waymo launched a robotaxi service earlier this year in Austin. Now, Uber has expanded to the Middle East with WeRide in Abu Dhabi — with even more cities to come, including Dubai. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi forecast in the company’s third-quarter earnings report that there would be autonomous vehicle deployments on the Uber network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Uber and WeRide have previously shared plans to expand to 15 cities throughout the Middle East and Europe, eventually scaling to thousands of robotaxis. That would represent a massive leap for WeRide, which today has more than 150 robotaxis in the region.",

            "content": "Spotify is planning to raise subscription prices in the U.S. in the first quarter of next year, according to a new report from the Financial Times . The move will mark the streaming service’s first price rise in the U.S. since July 2024 . The company recently raised prices in several other countries, including the U.K., Switzerland, and Australia. A Spotify subscription currently costs $11.99 a month in the U.S. When the service first launched in the country 14 years ago, it cost $9.99 per month. The report says JPMorgan analysts have estimated that a $1-per-month price increase in the U.S. could increase Spotify’s annual revenue by about $500 million. Additionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix. The report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO . The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, the current co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.",

            "content": "$6 Fake iPhone Pocket Already Available Wednesday November 26, 2025 6:20 am PST by Hartley Charlton Days after Apple's iPhone Pocket sold out around the world, fake versions of the accessory have started to become available online. Earlier this month, Apple introduced the ‌iPhone‌ Pocket in collaboration with Japanese fashion brand ISSEY MIYAKE. The 3D-knitted limited edition accessory is designed to carry an ‌iPhone‌. The accessory is like a stretchy pocket, not unlike an iPod Sock, but elongated to form a strap made of a ribbed, elastic textile that fully encloses an ‌iPhone‌ yet allows you to glimpse the display through its open structure. It comes in a short strap variant for $149.95 and a long strap variant for $229.95. The ‌iPhone‌ Pocket became available to order on Apple's online store starting Friday, November 14, in the United States, France, China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. It quickly sold out around the world. Now, lookalike versions of the accessories have started to become available on Chinese sites like AliExpress , where you can buy an ‌iPhone‌ Pocket clone for as little as $6 . Some listings describe it as a 1:1 replica, but there is no ISSEY MIYAKE print on the label. They describe the accessory as being made with the same production processes. Both the short and long variants are available in all of the original color options. Apple products and accessories are often replicated by manufacturers in China, but the turnaround for these particular copies has been especially fast. As with most reproductions, quality can vary, yet for customers who missed out on the limited-edition release, found it too expensive, or simply like the aesthetic, the dramatically lower price of these lookalikes may make them a tempting alternative.

Follow Follow See All Tech Dyson’s new Supersonic is the Tesla of hair dryers I want one, but I won’t buy one by Lauren Goode Close Lauren Goode Last published Mar 29, 2018 Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. Follow Follow See All by Lauren Goode Dec 21, 2016, 2:01 PM UTC Link Share Vjeran Pavic The hair-and-makeup tax is a real thing. It might be difficult to fully grasp the amount of time it takes people with long hair, or people who feel a whole lot better with a little bit of makeup on, to get ready to head out the door if you fall into neither category, but trust me: it takes time away from other things you’d rather be doing. So when Dyson said earlier this year that it had reinvented the hair dryer, building one with a powerful 13-blade motor, high-velocity airstream, and temperature control, I took the bait. Tech! Of course new tech would fix the problem. I’ll be honest, I was hesitant to even write about it for The Verge because I assumed most of our audience wouldn’t share the same enthusiasm, but the promise of this hair dryer was too great: with the Supersonic, my morning routine would be expedited; my hair would be flawless; hell, even my bathroom sink would be less cluttered. Right? Right? Reality came fast — faster than you can say “makeup tax,” when I learned that the Supersonic cost $400. The Toyota Corolla of hair dryers this is not; it is more like a Tesla, fast and sleek and also out of my price range. I’ve spent the past couple weeks comparing my standard, $21 Conair with this new Supersonic, and I’ve determined that Dyson’s version of the hair dryer is completely covetable. But still: that’s a lot of money to pay for dry hair. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Dyson is known for its vacuums, and while a vacuum isn’t exactly something you’d envision putting close to your head, Dyson has borrowed technology from its modern vacuums and put it in this hair dryer. Specifically, the hair dryer has been built with Dyson’s “digital motor” technology, which is a brushless, direct current motor that is supposed to suffer less wear and tear over time. Dyson also says the motor spins at 110,000 revolutions per minute compared with 20,000 to 30,000 RPM for standard hair dryers. The Dyson Supersonic is the Tesla of hair dryers That’s some of the technical jargon behind the product, but what it means for practical purposes is that the motor is a tiny, 1-inch-wide thing that fits in the handle of the hair dryer rather than in the nozzle. The result is a light, 1.8-pound hair dryer with evenly distributed weight. When you hold the Dyson in one hand and a “regular” hair dryer in the other, you get a sense of how top-heavy other models are when compared to the Dyson. And when you’re using it for several consecutive minutes, you do start to appreciate this weight distribution. The internals also inform the aesthetics of the product. The plastic head of the Dyson is an open-ended sphere rather than an elongated nozzle with a filter on the backend. There are exactly four buttons on the back of the hair dryer: a power button, a cool air button, heat settings, and air-flow control. The air and heat levels appear in a series of LED lights along the barrel. The filter, which is on the handle, has the word “Filtre” etched on it (I assumed this was because Dyson is a British company, but “filtre” is ... French). The design is undeniably elegant. As one hair stylist remarked when I asked him whether he had been using the Dyson in his salon, it looks like the kind of hair dryer that “those people with ‘Dwell’ homes would have.” Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge But as with most new gadgets, what it can <em>do</em> is more important than its looks. Over the past two weeks I ran a series of tests with both the 1600-watt Dyson Supersonic and the Conair 1875-watt Turbo Style, which I picked up at my local drugstore for a mere $21. Starting with towel-dried hair and a spritz of heat protectant product, I timed how long it took to go from wet hair to dry — no elaborate styling, just some brushing and head-flipping. First off: the Dyson Supersonic is not as quiet as you might think. There’s no doubt the whir of the high-tech hair dryer comes in at a different pitch than the blustery Conair, but it’s not like you’re safe from waking your sleeping roommate with the Dyson. It costs $400 and didn’t dry my hair that much faster than a $21 Conair did But the biggest surprise was that the Dyson didn’t dry my hair in significantly less time than the Conair did. Both dryers took somewhere between f",

        "title": "Microsoft's AI chatbot Copilot leaves WhatsApp on January 15 | TechCrunch",
        "content": "Microsoft’s AI chatbot Copilot will no longer be available on WhatsApp after January 15, the company has shared. After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the web . The company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month . At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI , Perplexity , and others. OpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January. Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.",

        "content": "$6 Fake iPhone Pocket Already Available Wednesday November 26, 2025 6:20 am PST by Hartley Charlton Days after Apple's iPhone Pocket sold out around the world, fake versions of the accessory have started to become available online. Earlier this month, Apple introduced the ‌iPhone‌ Pocket in collaboration with Japanese fashion brand ISSEY MIYAKE. The 3D-knitted limited edition accessory is designed to carry an ‌iPhone‌. The accessory is like a stretchy pocket, not unlike an iPod Sock, but elongated to form a strap made of a ribbed, elastic textile that fully encloses an ‌iPhone‌ yet allows you to glimpse the display through its open structure. It comes in a short strap variant for $149.95 and a long strap variant for $229.95. The ‌iPhone‌ Pocket became available to order on Apple's online store starting Friday, November 14, in the United States, France, China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. It quickly sold out around the world. Now, lookalike versions of the accessories have started to become available on Chinese sites like AliExpress , where you can buy an ‌iPhone‌ Pocket clone for as little as $6 . Some listings describe it as a 1:1 replica, but there is no ISSEY MIYAKE print on the label. They describe the accessory as being made with the same production processes. Both the short and long variants are available in all of the original color options. Apple products and accessories are often replicated by manufacturers in China, but the turnaround for these particular copies has been especially fast. As with most reproductions, quality can vary, yet for customers who missed out on the limited-edition release, found it too expensive, or simply like the aesthetic, the dramatically lower price of these lookalikes may make them a tempting alternative.

        "content": "Spotify is planning to raise subscription prices in the U.S. in the first quarter of next year, according to a new report from the Financial Times . The move will mark the streaming service’s first price rise in the U.S. since July 2024 . The company recently raised prices in several other countries, including the U.K., Switzerland, and Australia. A Spotify subscription currently costs $11.99 a month in the U.S. When the service first launched in the country 14 years ago, it cost $9.99 per month. The report says JPMorgan analysts have estimated that a $1-per-month price increase in the U.S. could increase Spotify’s annual revenue by about $500 million. Additionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix. The report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO . The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, the current co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.",

Follow Follow See All by Lauren Goode Dec 21, 2016, 2:01 PM UTC Link Share Vjeran Pavic The hair-and-makeup tax is a real thing. It might be difficult to fully grasp the amount of time it takes people with long hair, or people who feel a whole lot better with a little bit of makeup on, to get ready to head out the door if you fall into neither category, but trust me: it takes time away from other things you’d rather be doing. So when Dyson said earlier this year that it had reinvented the hair dryer, building one with a powerful 13-blade motor, high-velocity airstream, and temperature control, I took the bait. Tech! Of course new tech would fix the problem. I’ll be honest, I was hesitant to even write about it for The Verge because I assumed most of our audience wouldn’t share the same enthusiasm, but the promise of this hair dryer was too great: with the Supersonic, my morning routine would be expedited; my hair would be flawless; hell, even my bathroom sink would be less cluttered. Right? Right? Reality came fast — faster than you can say “makeup tax,” when I learned that the Supersonic cost $400. The Toyota Corolla of hair dryers this is not; it is more like a Tesla, fast and sleek and also out of my price range. I’ve spent the past couple weeks comparing my standard, $21 Conair with this new Supersonic, and I’ve determined that Dyson’s version of the hair dryer is completely covetable. But still: that’s a lot of money to pay for dry hair. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Dyson is known for its vacuums, and while a vacuum isn’t exactly something you’d envision putting close to your head, Dyson has borrowed technology from its modern vacuums and put it in this hair dryer. Specifically, the hair dryer has been built with Dyson’s “digital motor” technology, which is a brushless, direct current motor that is supposed to suffer less wear and tear over time. Dyson also says the motor spins at 110,000 revolutions per minute compared with 20,000 to 30,000 RPM for standard hair dryers. The Dyson Supersonic is the Tesla of hair dryers That’s some of the technical jargon behind the product, but what it means for practical purposes is that the motor is a tiny, 1-inch-wide thing that fits in the handle of the hair dryer rather than in the nozzle. The result is a light, 1.8-pound hair dryer with evenly distributed weight. When you hold the Dyson in one hand and a “regular” hair dryer in the other, you get a sense of how top-heavy other models are when compared to the Dyson. And when you’re using it for several consecutive minutes, you do start to appreciate this weight distribution. The internals also inform the aesthetics of the product. The plastic head of the Dyson is an open-ended sphere rather than an elongated nozzle with a filter on the backend. There are exactly four buttons on the back of the hair dryer: a power button, a cool air button, heat settings, and air-flow control. The air and heat levels appear in a series of LED lights along the barrel. The filter, which is on the handle, has the word “Filtre” etched on it (I assumed this was because Dyson is a British company, but “filtre” is ... French). The design is undeniably elegant. As one hair stylist remarked when I asked him whether he had been using the Dyson in his salon, it looks like the kind of hair dryer that “those people with ‘Dwell’ homes would have.” Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge But as with most new gadgets, what it can <em>do</em> is more important than its looks. Over the past two weeks I ran a series of tests with both the 1600-watt Dyson Supersonic and the Conair 1875-watt Turbo Style, which I picked up at my local drugstore for a mere $21. Starting with towel-dried hair and a spritz of heat protectant product, I timed how long it took to go from wet hair to dry — no elaborate styling, just some brushing and head-flipping. First off: the Dyson Supersonic is not as quiet as you might think. There’s no doubt the whir of the high-tech hair dryer comes in at a different pitch than the blustery Conair, but it’s not like you’re safe from waking your sleeping roommate with the Dyson. It costs $400 and didn’t dry my hair that much faster than a $21 Conair did But the biggest surprise was that the Dyson didn’t dry my hair in significantly less time than the Conair did. Both dryers took somewhere between f",
