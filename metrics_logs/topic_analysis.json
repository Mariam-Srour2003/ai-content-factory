The main types of acne, according to the Cleveland Clinic , are: blackheads, whiteheads, pimples (pustules), papules, nodules, and cysts. 5 Comedonal acne (blackheads and whiteheads) is considered a mild form of acne that can occur when your pores become clogged with oil, bacteria, or dead skin cells.

A derivative of vitamin A, retinol helps to promote the skin’s natural exfoliation process—which can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. With continued use, it can also help to improve the skin's texture, and even skin tone. Although it is most frequently found in anti-aging products, retinol is also beneficial for those with acne-prone skin as well. It can help keep your skin clear, improve the appearance of post-acne marks (also called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), reduce the appearance of visible pores, and help to refine the skin's texture. Frequently Asked Questions Retinol helps to improve the appearance of skin by increasing the rate of skin cell turnover. Retinol promotes the skin’s natural exfoliation process which helps to refine the skin's texture. This helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve tone and texture, and improve the appearance of post-acne marks. CeraVe’s retinol products are gentle enough to use every day. Whether you’re wondering how to use retinol for acne, or looking to add an anti-aging serum to your skincare routine, or minimize the look of hyperpigmentation, we have a retinol formula just for you. Because retinol can break down when exposed to sunlight, we recommend storing your product in a cool, dark space. Retinol can make skin photosensitive, so we advise using your chosen product primarily at night, though products with retinol can be used during the day when combined with a sunscreen . Not sure how much retinol to use? When in doubt, follow the instructions on the packaging of your chosen retinol product. If you’re interested in pairing your retinol product with an AHA, we recommend consulting your dermatologist to determine if using these ingredients together is right for your skin, and the best way to use them together. When layered or alternated, the active profiles of AHA and retinol treatments can cause skin sensitization or discomfort for some users.

Find the Best Facial Moisturizer for Your Skin Below, explore our range of facial moisturizers and discover the right option for your skin’s unique needs. Frequently Asked Questions Yes, daily moisturizing is an essential part of any well-rounded skincare routine. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends applying moisturizer as part of your morning and evening routine, regardless of your skin type . 1 Your skin requires plenty of moisture to look and feel its best, and the right face moisturizer can help keep your skin looking hydrated, supple, and smooth.

Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Important Things to Know about Sensitive Skin The key to addressing the needs of sensitive skin is first to find out the cause of your skin sensitivity. A board-certified dermatologist can help you determine the root cause of your hypersensitivity and develop a gentle and effective skincare routine. No matter the cause of your sensitive skin, it is always a good idea to stay away from skincare products with fragrances—and other irritants, like alcohol—and rely on products that hydrate and protect your skin barrier. Sensitive skin is a skin type characterized by skin hypersensitivity often caused by cosmetics, skincare products, and specific climate conditions. It is possible to have more than one skin type, so your skin can be oily, dry, or combination, as well as sensitive. If you experience skin irritation on your face or body—such as red bumps, dryness, redness, or cracked skin after applying cosmetics or skincare products—or after being exposed to certain environmental conditions, you likely have sensitive skin. 1 For further guidance, always be sure to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. While sensitive skin is a common skincare concern, there is not much known about the underlying causes of skin sensitivity. If you want to learn more about what is causing your sensitive skin, we recommend scheduling an appointment with a board-certified dermatologist. 1.

If you are dealing with visible redness, cracked, or dry skin , you may benefit from incorporating products that are formulated to soothe skin sensitivity into your skincare routine.

Whether your hypersensitive skin is prone to dryness, breakouts , or red bumps, we have a product to help support healthy-looking skin and avoid irritation in sensitive skin. Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Important Things to Know about Sensitive Skin The key to addressing the needs of sensitive skin is first to find out the cause of your skin sensitivity. A board-certified dermatologist can help you determine the root cause of your hypersensitivity and develop a gentle and effective skincare routine. No matter the cause of your sensitive skin, it is always a good idea to stay away from skincare products with fragrances—and other irritants, like alcohol—and rely on products that hydrate and protect your skin barrier. Sensitive skin is a skin type characterized by skin hypersensitivity often caused by cosmetics, skincare products, and specific climate conditions. It is possible to have more than one skin type, so your skin can be oily, dry, or combination, as well as sensitive. If you experience skin irritation on your face or body—such as red bumps, dryness, redness, or cracked skin after applying cosmetics or skincare products—or after being exposed to certain environmental conditions, you likely have sensitive skin. 1 For further guidance, always be sure to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. While sensitive skin is a common skincare concern, there is not much known about the underlying causes of skin sensitivity. If you want to learn more about what is causing your sensitive skin, we recommend scheduling an appointment with a board-certified dermatologist. 1.

The main types of acne, according to the Cleveland Clinic , are: blackheads, whiteheads, pimples (pustules), papules, nodules, and cysts. 5 Comedonal acne (blackheads and whiteheads) is considered a mild form of acne that can occur when your pores become clogged with oil, bacteria, or dead skin cells.

          "content": "FIND THE PERFECT GIFT FOR YOU & YOURS: TAKE THE GIFT FINDER 🎁 Products Formulated with Retinol Need more knowledge about Retinol? A derivative of vitamin A, retinol helps to promote the skin’s natural exfoliation process—which can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. With continued use, it can also help to improve the skin's texture, and even skin tone. Although it is most frequently found in anti-aging products, retinol is also beneficial for those with acne-prone skin as well. It can help keep your skin clear, improve the appearance of post-acne marks (also called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), reduce the appearance of visible pores, and help to refine the skin's texture. Frequently Asked Questions Retinol helps to improve the appearance of skin by increasing the rate of skin cell turnover. Retinol promotes the skin’s natural exfoliation process which helps to refine the skin's texture. This helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve tone and texture, and improve the appearance of post-acne marks. CeraVe’s retinol products are gentle enough to use every day. Whether you’re wondering how to use retinol for acne, or looking to add an anti-aging serum to your skincare routine, or minimize the look of hyperpigmentation, we have a retinol formula just for you. Because retinol can break down when exposed to sunlight, we recommend storing your product in a cool, dark space. Retinol can make skin photosensitive, so we advise using your chosen product primarily at night, though products with retinol can be used during the day when combined with a sunscreen . Not sure how much retinol to use? When in doubt, follow the instructions on the packaging of your chosen retinol product. If you’re interested in pairing your retinol product with an AHA, we recommend consulting your dermatologist to determine if using these ingredients together is right for your skin, and the best way to use them together. When layered or alternated, the active profiles of AHA and retinol treatments can cause skin sensitization or discomfort for some users.

The main types of acne, according to the Cleveland Clinic , are: blackheads, whiteheads, pimples (pustules), papules, nodules, and cysts. 5 Comedonal acne (blackheads and whiteheads) is considered a mild form of acne that can occur when your pores become clogged with oil, bacteria, or dead skin cells.

A derivative of vitamin A, retinol helps to promote the skin’s natural exfoliation process—which can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. With continued use, it can also help to improve the skin's texture, and even skin tone. Although it is most frequently found in anti-aging products, retinol is also beneficial for those with acne-prone skin as well. It can help keep your skin clear, improve the appearance of post-acne marks (also called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), reduce the appearance of visible pores, and help to refine the skin's texture. Frequently Asked Questions Retinol helps to improve the appearance of skin by increasing the rate of skin cell turnover. Retinol promotes the skin’s natural exfoliation process which helps to refine the skin's texture. This helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve tone and texture, and improve the appearance of post-acne marks. CeraVe’s retinol products are gentle enough to use every day. Whether you’re wondering how to use retinol for acne, or looking to add an anti-aging serum to your skincare routine, or minimize the look of hyperpigmentation, we have a retinol formula just for you. Because retinol can break down when exposed to sunlight, we recommend storing your product in a cool, dark space. Retinol can make skin photosensitive, so we advise using your chosen product primarily at night, though products with retinol can be used during the day when combined with a sunscreen . Not sure how much retinol to use? When in doubt, follow the instructions on the packaging of your chosen retinol product. If you’re interested in pairing your retinol product with an AHA, we recommend consulting your dermatologist to determine if using these ingredients together is right for your skin, and the best way to use them together. When layered or alternated, the active profiles of AHA and retinol treatments can cause skin sensitization or discomfort for some users.

Frequently Asked Questions Yes, daily moisturizing is an essential part of any well-rounded skincare routine.

If you are dealing with visible redness, cracked, or dry skin , you may benefit from incorporating products that are formulated to soothe skin sensitivity into your skincare routine. Our products for sensitive skin, which include cleansers , moisturizers , serums , and sunscreens , are formulated with ceramides to help restore your skin’s protective barrier and lock in moisture. Whether your hypersensitive skin is prone to dryness, breakouts , or red bumps, we have a product to help support healthy-looking skin and avoid irritation in sensitive skin. Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Important Things to Know about Sensitive Skin The key to addressing the needs of sensitive skin is first to find out the cause of your skin sensitivity. A board-certified dermatologist can help you determine the root cause of your hypersensitivity and develop a gentle and effective skincare routine. No matter the cause of your sensitive skin, it is always a good idea to stay away from skincare products with fragrances—and other irritants, like alcohol—and rely on products that hydrate and protect your skin barrier. Sensitive skin is a skin type characterized by skin hypersensitivity often caused by cosmetics, skincare products, and specific climate conditions. It is possible to have more than one skin type, so your skin can be oily, dry, or combination, as well as sensitive. If you experience skin irritation on your face or body—such as red bumps, dryness, redness, or cracked skin after applying cosmetics or skincare products—or after being exposed to certain environmental conditions, you likely have sensitive skin. 1 For further guidance, always be sure to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. While sensitive skin is a common skincare concern, there is not much known about the underlying causes of skin sensitivity. If you want to learn more about what is causing your sensitive skin, we recommend scheduling an appointment with a board-certified dermatologist. 1.
