Dimethicone is the oldest and most prevalent silicone-based ingredient in skincare , haircare, and cosmetics, and it’s frequently found in moisturizers , as well as in other skin-softening and smoothing emollients . 1,2 It has a silky texture that enables it to glide luxuriously over skin. Because of its consistency and matte finish, it can also be helpful for concealing redness and blemishes , as well as helping disguise enlarged pores and fine lines . 2 Other dimethicone uses include helping to maintain moisture in your skin and keeping environmental irritants out by supporting your skin’s protective barrier . 1 While there are varying opinions on the use of dimethicone in skincare, experts agree that silicones are safe and do not pose a risk to humans when used in skincare products. In fact, dimethicone is frequently used to both help manage and prevent skin issues, like dry skin and minor skin irritations, with minimal to no risk of side effects. 2,3 The restorative qualities of dimethicone make it a highly sought-after skincare ingredient in moisturizers and creams. Below, discover which CeraVe products feature this beneficial ingredient. Frequently Asked Questions If you have questions about what dimethicone is, wonder what some dimethicone for skin benefits are, or feel like getting to the bottom of other dimethicone myths, check out our frequently asked questions about the ingredient below. Dimethicone is a fluid type of silicone with a highly flexible synthetic makeup, and it’s the oldest and most used silicone in skincare, haircare, and cosmetic products. 1,2 Dimethicone cream, dimethicone ointment, and dimethicone lotions are widespread and can be especially helpful for those with oily , acne-prone skin , or sensitive skin . This is because dimethicone is frequently in oil-free skincare and can help your skin retain moisture without leaving a greasy feel or clogging your pores. It’s also hypoallergenic, has minimal to no risk of side effects, and is used to help manage or prevent certain skin conditions. 3,4 Based on its protective, hydrating, and soothing properties, it’s no surprise why products with dimethicone are so popular. 5 Dimethicone has both emollient and occlusive properties, meaning it softens and smooths skin, helps lock in hydration, and improves skin barrier function. 4,6 Interestingly, although dimethicone won’t dissolve in water, water vapor can penetrate it, so it does a great job of retaining moisture in the skin without suffocating it. 1 It also has a silky matte texture, which helps hide redness, blemishes, enlarged pores, and fine lines, and a consistency that effortlessly glides across skin. 2 Other benefits of dimethicone in skincare are that it’s hypoallergenic, fragrance-free, and won’t clog your pores. It’s present in some body washes, too, since it helps improve creaminess, stability, and the overall quality of foamed up lather. 1 In haircare, dimethicone is often found in two-in-one shampoo/conditioners, because it can protect the hair shaft during washing and help boost volume. What dimethicone is used for in skincare centers around its ability to help with moisturization, which is tied to its skin-softening and barrier-supporting properties. It also helps visibly smooth the appearance of skin, such as with enlarged pores and fine lines, and camouflages redness and blemishes. 1,2 Dimethicone is a type of silicone called a “linear polysiloxane” or “polydimethylsiloxane.” It’s a very strong and resilient ingredient yet it’s also flexible. Some other features of silicones, like dimethicone, are that they’re noncarcinogenic, nontoxic, hypoallergenic, odorless, and colorless. There are myriad products that contain dimethicone in skincare. Some of the most prevalent products are moisturizers, as well as dimethicone cream and dimethicone ointment. This is because the ingredient helps keep skin hydrated, soothed, and protected against damage. 1,5 But dimethicone isn’t just limited to skincare. It also has a place in many cosmetic and haircare formulations, especially as a protectant in two-in-one shampoo/conditioners. 1,2 At CeraVe, you can find dimethicone in several of our therapeutic products, like CeraVe Therapeutic Hand Cream .

Step 1 Facial Cleansers Step 2 Treatment Step 3 Facial Moisturizers Step 4 Sunscreen Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Need more knowledge about rough and bumpy skin? Rough and bumpy skin , sometimes known as “chicken skin,” can occur at any age or stage of life. Rough skin and/or bumpy skin can be caused by dryness, a buildup of dead skin cells, or certain skin conditions such as eczema , 1 psoriasis , 2 diabetes , 3 or keratosis pilaris 4 ; the latter of which is caused when keratin blocks hair follicles. CeraVe’s head-to-toe products for rough and bumpy skin contain salicylic acid and lactic acid to help improve skin’s natural turnover and visibly smooth texture. Each face and body cleanser, body wash, lotion, and cream is formulated with three essential ceramides to restore and maintain your skin barrier, which helps lock in moisture and keep irritants out. FAQ Both salicylic acid and lactic acid are gentle exfoliants that help treat rough patches of skin, albeit in slightly different ways. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that is derived from the bark of certain plants. It works by loosening the “glue” that holds the skin cells on the top layer together. By helping your skin shed dead skin cells faster, newer, healthier-looking skin is revealed, leaving it feeling softer and smoother. Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid that’s a natural byproduct of plant and dairy fermentation. It is known to help loosen the bonds that hold dead skin cells together to leave your skin softer, smoother, and with enhanced overall texture. 5 But lactic acid has another trick up its sleeve. Since it’s part of the skin’s natural moisturizing factor, or NMF, it helps keep your skin hydrated as well. 6 T. Ruzicka, B. Przybilla, J.

Removing your makeup at the end of each day is an essential part of maintaining healthy-looking skin. CeraVe’s makeup removers and makeup-removing cleanser s gently wash away all traces of makeup, dirt, and excess oil to help keep your skin clean and free from pore-clogging materials. Formulated with three essential ceramides and key ingredients , such as hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil, CeraVe face and eye makeup removers can remove even the most stubborn longwear makeup (including waterproof mascara) without disrupting the protective skin barrier or leaving your skin feeling stripped. As the perfect first step in your nighttime skin care routine , or a convenient option on the go, CeraVe makeup-removers are available in a variety of hydrating and nourishing formulas—including our Makeup Removing Cleanser Balm , Hydrating Makeup Removing Plant-Based Wipes , Hydrating Cream-To-Foam Cleanser , Hydrating Micellar Water, and ophthalmologist-tested eye makeup removers—like CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover . Whatever your makeup-removing needs, there’s a CeraVe makeup remover for your skin type. FAQ Sometimes, cleansing alone isn’t enough to fully remove all traces of makeup. A makeup remover can help gently and effectively eliminate makeup, excess oil, and dirt from your skin. By preventing the build-up of pore-clogging materials that may lead to skin concerns like blackheads and acne blemishes , makeup removers can help support skin that appears healthy and clear. Makeup removers easily dissolve debris, therefore helping to prevent rough tugging or pulling on the skin while removing makeup. CeraVe makeup removers are available in a variety of forms to suit all skin types , including our face wipes, cleansing balm, oil-free micellar water, and Comforting Eye Makeup Remover. Makeup removers are formulated with certain areas of your face in mind—as well as different skin types (such as oil y , dry , sensitive , or combination skin). An eye makeup remover is formulated specifically for the delicate eye area, which is the thinnest skin on your entire body and requires special care. Alternately, a face makeup remover is intended to remove makeup on your face. Some face makeup removers are also suitable for use on the eye area, but this isn’t always the case—as some facial products may include ingredients in concentrations that are too harsh for the delicate eye area.

Dry skin (formally known as xeroderma) is a common skin concern that can occur seasonally or year-round. It’s caused when your skin’s protective barrier is weakened, resulting in a loss of moisture in the skin’s outermost layer. Whether it's on your face , hands, feet , or anywhere else on your body, dry skin can feel tight, itchy , and uncomfortable. It may also appear visibly rough , scaly , or flaky . CeraVe’s expansive range of face and body products helps relieve the feelings of discomfort caused by dry skin. Our skincare products for dry skin are formulated with gentle, hydrating, and soothing ingredients , plus three essential ceramides to lock in moisture and help maintain your skin’s protective barrier. From cleansers to moisturizers , ointments , and more, CeraVe’s best products for dry skin offer fragrance-free , dermatologist-developed options to help reduce dryness and support hydrated, soft, healthy-looking skin. Find Our Best Products for Dry Skin Explore our range of skincare products for dry skin to find the right option for your skin’s unique needs—now and throughout the year. Frequently Asked Questions Dry skin, which affects most of us at some point in our lives, can have many possible causes. It can be influenced by both internal and external factors, including low humidity, cold weather , certain skin conditions or illnesses, and taking excessively long, hot showers. 1 A board-certified dermatologist can help identify the root cause(s) of your dry skin, as well as recommend the best products for dry skin to help you restore the look of hydrated, smooth, more comfortable-feeling skin. To learn more about dry skin causes, head to our guide on dry vs. dehydrated skin . Everyone’s skin is unique. This means that—depending on factors like your age , environment, and health status—signs of dry skin can vary from person to person. According to the Mayo Clinic , when skin loses too much moisture, you may experience a feeling of tightness, as well as rough texture, itchiness, flaking, and more visible fine lines. These signs of dry skin may worsen with age (especially over 40), as well as during the harsh, dry winter months 1 . That’s why it’s so important to listen to your skin and seek the help of a dermatologist when needed. To help tackle dry skin, you’ll need a targeted skincare routine that helps preserve and enhance skin moisture levels. We recommend using a gentle, yet effective cleanser for dry skin twice daily to remove excess oil and dirt, without leaving your skin feeling stripped. Applying moisturizer regularly—especially after bathing when your skin is still slightly damp—is another important step to help hydrate and soothe dry skin. It may also be helpful to carry travel-friendly skincare products for dry skin, like moisturizing hand cream or ointment, to help relieve dryness on-the-go. Proper sun protective measures should also be a core part of your daily dry skin regimen since damage from the sun’s harmful rays may worsen dryness 1 . For further guidance on how to help relieve dry skin, consult with your physician or dermatologist. Dry skin that is painful, cracks, bleeds, or interferes with your quality of life should always be assessed by a medical professional and may be a sign of an underlying illness 1 . When looking for the best products for dry skin, check the label for beneficial ingredients (like hyaluronic acid , glycerin, and niacinamide ) and seals of approval from reputable organizations (like the National Eczema Association). The American Academy of Dermatology AAD , for instance, recommends avoiding products that contain alcohol, fragrance, or harsh chemical exfoliants, as these may be irritating to dry skin or strip away natural oils. 2 This is one of many reasons all CeraVe products for dry skin are fragrance-free and developed with dermatologists . Formulated with three essential ceramides , they also help to lock in moisture and help maintain your skin’s protective barrier. Ceramides (pronounced “sair-uh-mydes”) are essential natural fatty components of human and animal skin, making up around 50% of its outer layer. They’re essential in helping to replenish and maintain your natural protective skin barrier, which helps keep moisture in and harmful elements out. 3 When there’s a lack of humidity in the air, the levels of ceramides in your skin become depleted, leading to dry skin and other issues. Plus, as we age, our natural production of ceramides slows down. Both of these factors can contribute to dry skin either seasonally or year-round. 3 This is why ceramides are such an effective ingredient in skincare products for dry skin, as well as for healthy-looking skin in general. In addition to skin-essential ceramides, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends looking f",

Dry skin (formally known as xeroderma) is a common skin concern that can occur seasonally or year-round. It’s caused when your skin’s protective barrier is weakened, resulting in a loss of moisture in the skin’s outermost layer. Whether it's on your face , hands, feet , or anywhere else on your body, dry skin can feel tight, itchy , and uncomfortable. It may also appear visibly rough , scaly , or flaky . CeraVe’s expansive range of face and body products helps relieve the feelings of discomfort caused by dry skin. Our skincare products for dry skin are formulated with gentle, hydrating, and soothing ingredients , plus three essential ceramides to lock in moisture and help maintain your skin’s protective barrier. From cleansers to moisturizers , ointments , and more, CeraVe’s best products for dry skin offer fragrance-free , dermatologist-developed options to help reduce dryness and support hydrated, soft, healthy-looking skin. Find Our Best Products for Dry Skin Explore our range of skincare products for dry skin to find the right option for your skin’s unique needs—now and throughout the year. Frequently Asked Questions Dry skin, which affects most of us at some point in our lives, can have many possible causes. It can be influenced by both internal and external factors, including low humidity, cold weather , certain skin conditions or illnesses, and taking excessively long, hot showers. 1 A board-certified dermatologist can help identify the root cause(s) of your dry skin, as well as recommend the best products for dry skin to help you restore the look of hydrated, smooth, more comfortable-feeling skin. To learn more about dry skin causes, head to our guide on dry vs. dehydrated skin . Everyone’s skin is unique. This means that—depending on factors like your age , environment, and health status—signs of dry skin can vary from person to person. According to the Mayo Clinic , when skin loses too much moisture, you may experience a feeling of tightness, as well as rough texture, itchiness, flaking, and more visible fine lines. These signs of dry skin may worsen with age (especially over 40), as well as during the harsh, dry winter months 1 . That’s why it’s so important to listen to your skin and seek the help of a dermatologist when needed. To help tackle dry skin, you’ll need a targeted skincare routine that helps preserve and enhance skin moisture levels. We recommend using a gentle, yet effective cleanser for dry skin twice daily to remove excess oil and dirt, without leaving your skin feeling stripped. Applying moisturizer regularly—especially after bathing when your skin is still slightly damp—is another important step to help hydrate and soothe dry skin. It may also be helpful to carry travel-friendly skincare products for dry skin, like moisturizing hand cream or ointment, to help relieve dryness on-the-go. Proper sun protective measures should also be a core part of your daily dry skin regimen since damage from the sun’s harmful rays may worsen dryness 1 . For further guidance on how to help relieve dry skin, consult with your physician or dermatologist. Dry skin that is painful, cracks, bleeds, or interferes with your quality of life should always be assessed by a medical professional and may be a sign of an underlying illness 1 . When looking for the best products for dry skin, check the label for beneficial ingredients (like hyaluronic acid , glycerin, and niacinamide ) and seals of approval from reputable organizations (like the National Eczema Association). The American Academy of Dermatology AAD , for instance, recommends avoiding products that contain alcohol, fragrance, or harsh chemical exfoliants, as these may be irritating to dry skin or strip away natural oils. 2 This is one of many reasons all CeraVe products for dry skin are fragrance-free and developed with dermatologists . Formulated with three essential ceramides , they also help to lock in moisture and help maintain your skin’s protective barrier. Ceramides (pronounced “sair-uh-mydes”) are essential natural fatty components of human and animal skin, making up around 50% of its outer layer. They’re essential in helping to replenish and maintain your natural protective skin barrier, which helps keep moisture in and harmful elements out. 3 When there’s a lack of humidity in the air, the levels of ceramides in your skin become depleted, leading to dry skin and other issues. Plus, as we age, our natural production of ceramides slows down. Both of these factors can contribute to dry skin either seasonally or year-round. 3 This is why ceramides are such an effective ingredient in skincare products for dry skin, as well as for healthy-looking skin in general. In addition to skin-essential ceramides, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends looking f",

Step 1 Facial Cleansers Step 2 Treatment Step 3 Facial Moisturizers Step 4 Sunscreen Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Need more knowledge about rough and bumpy skin? Rough and bumpy skin , sometimes known as “chicken skin,” can occur at any age or stage of life. Rough skin and/or bumpy skin can be caused by dryness, a buildup of dead skin cells, or certain skin conditions such as eczema , 1 psoriasis , 2 diabetes , 3 or keratosis pilaris 4 ; the latter of which is caused when keratin blocks hair follicles. CeraVe’s head-to-toe products for rough and bumpy skin contain salicylic acid and lactic acid to help improve skin’s natural turnover and visibly smooth texture. Each face and body cleanser, body wash, lotion, and cream is formulated with three essential ceramides to restore and maintain your skin barrier, which helps lock in moisture and keep irritants out. FAQ Both salicylic acid and lactic acid are gentle exfoliants that help treat rough patches of skin, albeit in slightly different ways. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that is derived from the bark of certain plants. It works by loosening the “glue” that holds the skin cells on the top layer together. By helping your skin shed dead skin cells faster, newer, healthier-looking skin is revealed, leaving it feeling softer and smoother. Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid that’s a natural byproduct of plant and dairy fermentation. It is known to help loosen the bonds that hold dead skin cells together to leave your skin softer, smoother, and with enhanced overall texture. 5 But lactic acid has another trick up its sleeve. Since it’s part of the skin’s natural moisturizing factor, or NMF, it helps keep your skin hydrated as well. 6 T. Ruzicka, B. Przybilla, J.

Dimethicone is the oldest and most prevalent silicone-based ingredient in skincare , haircare, and cosmetics, and it’s frequently found in moisturizers , as well as in other skin-softening and smoothing emollients . 1,2 It has a silky texture that enables it to glide luxuriously over skin. Because of its consistency and matte finish, it can also be helpful for concealing redness and blemishes , as well as helping disguise enlarged pores and fine lines . 2 Other dimethicone uses include helping to maintain moisture in your skin and keeping environmental irritants out by supporting your skin’s protective barrier . 1 While there are varying opinions on the use of dimethicone in skincare, experts agree that silicones are safe and do not pose a risk to humans when used in skincare products. In fact, dimethicone is frequently used to both help manage and prevent skin issues, like dry skin and minor skin irritations, with minimal to no risk of side effects. 2,3 The restorative qualities of dimethicone make it a highly sought-after skincare ingredient in moisturizers and creams. Below, discover which CeraVe products feature this beneficial ingredient. Frequently Asked Questions If you have questions about what dimethicone is, wonder what some dimethicone for skin benefits are, or feel like getting to the bottom of other dimethicone myths, check out our frequently asked questions about the ingredient below. Dimethicone is a fluid type of silicone with a highly flexible synthetic makeup, and it’s the oldest and most used silicone in skincare, haircare, and cosmetic products. 1,2 Dimethicone cream, dimethicone ointment, and dimethicone lotions are widespread and can be especially helpful for those with oily , acne-prone skin , or sensitive skin . This is because dimethicone is frequently in oil-free skincare and can help your skin retain moisture without leaving a greasy feel or clogging your pores. It’s also hypoallergenic, has minimal to no risk of side effects, and is used to help manage or prevent certain skin conditions. 3,4 Based on its protective, hydrating, and soothing properties, it’s no surprise why products with dimethicone are so popular. 5 Dimethicone has both emollient and occlusive properties, meaning it softens and smooths skin, helps lock in hydration, and improves skin barrier function. 4,6 Interestingly, although dimethicone won’t dissolve in water, water vapor can penetrate it, so it does a great job of retaining moisture in the skin without suffocating it. 1 It also has a silky matte texture, which helps hide redness, blemishes, enlarged pores, and fine lines, and a consistency that effortlessly glides across skin. 2 Other benefits of dimethicone in skincare are that it’s hypoallergenic, fragrance-free, and won’t clog your pores. It’s present in some body washes, too, since it helps improve creaminess, stability, and the overall quality of foamed up lather. 1 In haircare, dimethicone is often found in two-in-one shampoo/conditioners, because it can protect the hair shaft during washing and help boost volume. What dimethicone is used for in skincare centers around its ability to help with moisturization, which is tied to its skin-softening and barrier-supporting properties. It also helps visibly smooth the appearance of skin, such as with enlarged pores and fine lines, and camouflages redness and blemishes. 1,2 Dimethicone is a type of silicone called a “linear polysiloxane” or “polydimethylsiloxane.” It’s a very strong and resilient ingredient yet it’s also flexible. Some other features of silicones, like dimethicone, are that they’re noncarcinogenic, nontoxic, hypoallergenic, odorless, and colorless. There are myriad products that contain dimethicone in skincare. Some of the most prevalent products are moisturizers, as well as dimethicone cream and dimethicone ointment. This is because the ingredient helps keep skin hydrated, soothed, and protected against damage. 1,5 But dimethicone isn’t just limited to skincare. It also has a place in many cosmetic and haircare formulations, especially as a protectant in two-in-one shampoo/conditioners. 1,2 At CeraVe, you can find dimethicone in several of our therapeutic products, like CeraVe Therapeutic Hand Cream .

Removing your makeup at the end of each day is an essential part of maintaining healthy-looking skin. CeraVe’s makeup removers and makeup-removing cleanser s gently wash away all traces of makeup, dirt, and excess oil to help keep your skin clean and free from pore-clogging materials. Formulated with three essential ceramides and key ingredients , such as hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil, CeraVe face and eye makeup removers can remove even the most stubborn longwear makeup (including waterproof mascara) without disrupting the protective skin barrier or leaving your skin feeling stripped. As the perfect first step in your nighttime skin care routine , or a convenient option on the go, CeraVe makeup-removers are available in a variety of hydrating and nourishing formulas—including our Makeup Removing Cleanser Balm , Hydrating Makeup Removing Plant-Based Wipes , Hydrating Cream-To-Foam Cleanser , Hydrating Micellar Water, and ophthalmologist-tested eye makeup removers—like CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover . Whatever your makeup-removing needs, there’s a CeraVe makeup remover for your skin type. FAQ Sometimes, cleansing alone isn’t enough to fully remove all traces of makeup. A makeup remover can help gently and effectively eliminate makeup, excess oil, and dirt from your skin. By preventing the build-up of pore-clogging materials that may lead to skin concerns like blackheads and acne blemishes , makeup removers can help support skin that appears healthy and clear. Makeup removers easily dissolve debris, therefore helping to prevent rough tugging or pulling on the skin while removing makeup. CeraVe makeup removers are available in a variety of forms to suit all skin types , including our face wipes, cleansing balm, oil-free micellar water, and Comforting Eye Makeup Remover. Makeup removers are formulated with certain areas of your face in mind—as well as different skin types (such as oil y , dry , sensitive , or combination skin). An eye makeup remover is formulated specifically for the delicate eye area, which is the thinnest skin on your entire body and requires special care. Alternately, a face makeup remover is intended to remove makeup on your face. Some face makeup removers are also suitable for use on the eye area, but this isn’t always the case—as some facial products may include ingredients in concentrations that are too harsh for the delicate eye area. Therefore, choosing the right product for each area is essential for optimal results. CeraVe’s face and eye makeup removers offer a variety of options for all skin types, with formulas that are non-comedogenic, paraben-free, fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and allergy-tested. Our makeup removers feature beneficial ingredients, such as three essential ceramides and jojoba oil. They are focused on hydrating, nourishing, and supporting a healthy-looking complexion, while maintaining the protective skin barrier. When in doubt, consult with a board-cer",

Dimethicone is the oldest and most prevalent silicone-based ingredient in skincare , haircare, and cosmetics, and it’s frequently found in moisturizers , as well as in other skin-softening and smoothing emollients . 1,2 It has a silky texture that enables it to glide luxuriously over skin. Because of its consistency and matte finish, it can also be helpful for concealing redness and blemishes , as well as helping disguise enlarged pores and fine lines . 2 Other dimethicone uses include helping to maintain moisture in your skin and keeping environmental irritants out by supporting your skin’s protective barrier . 1 While there are varying opinions on the use of dimethicone in skincare, experts agree that silicones are safe and do not pose a risk to humans when used in skincare products. In fact, dimethicone is frequently used to both help manage and prevent skin issues, like dry skin and minor skin irritations, with minimal to no risk of side effects. 2,3 The restorative qualities of dimethicone make it a highly sought-after skincare ingredient in moisturizers and creams. Below, discover which CeraVe products feature this beneficial ingredient. Frequently Asked Questions If you have questions about what dimethicone is, wonder what some dimethicone for skin benefits are, or feel like getting to the bottom of other dimethicone myths, check out our frequently asked questions about the ingredient below. Dimethicone is a fluid type of silicone with a highly flexible synthetic makeup, and it’s the oldest and most used silicone in skincare, haircare, and cosmetic products. 1,2 Dimethicone cream, dimethicone ointment, and dimethicone lotions are widespread and can be especially helpful for those with oily , acne-prone skin , or sensitive skin . This is because dimethicone is frequently in oil-free skincare and can help your skin retain moisture without leaving a greasy feel or clogging your pores. It’s also hypoallergenic, has minimal to no risk of side effects, and is used to help manage or prevent certain skin conditions. 3,4 Based on its protective, hydrating, and soothing properties, it’s no surprise why products with dimethicone are so popular. 5 Dimethicone has both emollient and occlusive properties, meaning it softens and smooths skin, helps lock in hydration, and improves skin barrier function. 4,6 Interestingly, although dimethicone won’t dissolve in water, water vapor can penetrate it, so it does a great job of retaining moisture in the skin without suffocating it. 1 It also has a silky matte texture, which helps hide redness, blemishes, enlarged pores, and fine lines, and a consistency that effortlessly glides across skin. 2 Other benefits of dimethicone in skincare are that it’s hypoallergenic, fragrance-free, and won’t clog your pores. It’s present in some body washes, too, since it helps improve creaminess, stability, and the overall quality of foamed up lather. 1 In haircare, dimethicone is often found in two-in-one shampoo/conditioners, because it can protect the hair shaft during washing and help boost volume. What dimethicone is used for in skincare centers around its ability to help with moisturization, which is tied to its skin-softening and barrier-supporting properties. It also helps visibly smooth the appearance of skin, such as with enlarged pores and fine lines, and camouflages redness and blemishes. 1,2 Dimethicone is a type of silicone called a “linear polysiloxane” or “polydimethylsiloxane.” It’s a very strong and resilient ingredient yet it’s also flexible. Some other features of silicones, like dimethicone, are that they’re noncarcinogenic, nontoxic, hypoallergenic, odorless, and colorless. There are myriad products that contain dimethicone in skincare. Some of the most prevalent products are moisturizers, as well as dimethicone cream and dimethicone ointment. This is because the ingredient helps keep skin hydrated, soothed, and protected against damage. 1,5 But dimethicone isn’t just limited to skincare.

Step 1 Facial Cleansers Step 2 Treatment Step 3 Facial Moisturizers Step 4 Sunscreen Skincare Solution Finder PERSONALIZED SKINCARE DEVELOPED WITH DERMATOLOGISTS READY AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TAKE THE QUIZ Need more knowledge about rough and bumpy skin? Rough and bumpy skin , sometimes known as “chicken skin,” can occur at any age or stage of life. Rough skin and/or bumpy skin can be caused by dryness, a buildup of dead skin cells, or certain skin conditions such as eczema , 1 psoriasis , 2 diabetes , 3 or keratosis pilaris 4 ; the latter of which is caused when keratin blocks hair follicles. CeraVe’s head-to-toe products for rough and bumpy skin contain salicylic acid and lactic acid to help improve skin’s natural turnover and visibly smooth texture. Each face and body cleanser, body wash, lotion, and cream is formulated with three essential ceramides to restore and maintain your skin barrier, which helps lock in moisture and keep irritants out. FAQ Both salicylic acid and lactic acid are gentle exfoliants that help treat rough patches of skin, albeit in slightly different ways. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that is derived from the bark of certain plants. It works by loosening the “glue” that holds the skin cells on the top layer together. By helping your skin shed dead skin cells faster, newer, healthier-looking skin is revealed, leaving it feeling softer and smoother. Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid that’s a natural byproduct of plant and dairy fermentation. It is known to help loosen the bonds that hold dead skin cells together to leave your skin softer, smoother, and with enhanced overall texture. 5 But lactic acid has another trick up its sleeve. Since it’s part of the skin’s natural moisturizing factor, or NMF, it helps keep your skin hydrated as well. 6 T. Ruzicka, B. Przybilla, J.

Removing your makeup at the end of each day is an essential part of maintaining healthy-looking skin. CeraVe’s makeup removers and makeup-removing cleanser s gently wash away all traces of makeup, dirt, and excess oil to help keep your skin clean and free from pore-clogging materials. Formulated with three essential ceramides and key ingredients , such as hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil, CeraVe face and eye makeup removers can remove even the most stubborn longwear makeup (including waterproof mascara) without disrupting the protective skin barrier or leaving your skin feeling stripped. As the perfect first step in your nighttime skin care routine , or a convenient option on the go, CeraVe makeup-removers are available in a variety of hydrating and nourishing formulas—including our Makeup Removing Cleanser Balm , Hydrating Makeup Removing Plant-Based Wipes , Hydrating Cream-To-Foam Cleanser , Hydrating Micellar Water, and ophthalmologist-tested eye makeup removers—like CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover . Whatever your makeup-removing needs, there’s a CeraVe makeup remover for your skin type. FAQ Sometimes, cleansing alone isn’t enough to fully remove all traces of makeup. A makeup remover can help gently and effectively eliminate makeup, excess oil, and dirt from your skin. By preventing the build-up of pore-clogging materials that may lead to skin concerns like blackheads and acne blemishes , makeup removers can help support skin that appears healthy and clear. Makeup removers easily dissolve debris, therefore helping to prevent rough tugging or pulling on the skin while removing makeup. CeraVe makeup removers are available in a variety of forms to suit all skin types , including our face wipes, cleansing balm, oil-free micellar water, and Comforting Eye Makeup Remover. Makeup removers are formulated with certain areas of your face in mind—as well as different skin types (such as oil y , dry , sensitive , or combination skin). An eye makeup remover is formulated specifically for the delicate eye area, which is the thinnest skin on your entire body and requires special care. Alternately, a face makeup remover is intended to remove makeup on your face. Some face makeup removers are also suitable for use on the eye area, but this isn’t always the case—as some facial products may include ingredients in concentrations that are too harsh for the delicate eye area. Therefore, choosing the right product for each area is essential for optimal results. CeraVe’s face and eye makeup removers offer a variety of options for all skin types, with formulas that are non-comedogenic, paraben-free, fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and allergy-tested. Our makeup removers feature beneficial ingredients, such as three essential ceramides and jojoba oil. They are focused on hydrating, nourishing, and supporting a healthy-looking complexion, while maintaining the protective skin barrier. When in doubt, consult with a board-cer",

Dry skin (formally known as xeroderma) is a common skin concern that can occur seasonally or year-round. It’s caused when your skin’s protective barrier is weakened, resulting in a loss of moisture in the skin’s outermost layer. Whether it's on your face , hands, feet , or anywhere else on your body, dry skin can feel tight, itchy , and uncomfortable. It may also appear visibly rough , scaly , or flaky . CeraVe’s expansive range of face and body products helps relieve the feelings of discomfort caused by dry skin. Our skincare products for dry skin are formulated with gentle, hydrating, and soothing ingredients , plus three essential ceramides to lock in moisture and help maintain your skin’s protective barrier. From cleansers to moisturizers , ointments , and more, CeraVe’s best products for dry skin offer fragrance-free , dermatologist-developed options to help reduce dryness and support hydrated, soft, healthy-looking skin. Find Our Best Products for Dry Skin Explore our range of skincare products for dry skin to find the right option for your skin’s unique needs—now and throughout the year. Frequently Asked Questions Dry skin, which affects most of us at some point in our lives, can have many possible causes. It can be influenced by both internal and external factors, including low humidity, cold weather , certain skin conditions or illnesses, and taking excessively long, hot showers. 1 A board-certified dermatologist can help identify the root cause(s) of your dry skin, as well as recommend the best products for dry skin to help you restore the look of hydrated, smooth, more comfortable-feeling skin. To learn more about dry skin causes, head to our guide on dry vs. dehydrated skin . Everyone’s skin is unique. This means that—depending on factors like your age , environment, and health status—signs of dry skin can vary from person to person. According to the Mayo Clinic , when skin loses too much moisture, you may experience a feeling of tightness, as well as rough texture, itchiness, flaking, and more visible fine lines. These signs of dry skin may worsen with age (especially over 40), as well as during the harsh, dry winter months 1 . That’s why it’s so important to listen to your skin and seek the help of a dermatologist when needed. To help tackle dry skin, you’ll need a targeted skincare routine that helps preserve and enhance skin moisture levels. We recommend using a gentle, yet effective cleanser for dry skin twice daily to remove excess oil and dirt, without leaving your skin feeling stripped. Applying moisturizer regularly—especially after bathing when your skin is still slightly damp—is another important step to help hydrate and soothe dry skin. It may also be helpful to carry travel-friendly skincare products for dry skin, like moisturizing hand cream or ointment, to help relieve dryness on-the-go. Proper sun protective measures should also be a core part of your daily dry skin regimen since damage from the sun’s harmful rays may worsen dryness 1 . For further guidance on how to help relieve dry skin, consult with your physician or dermatologist. Dry skin that is painful, cracks, bleeds, or interferes with your quality of life should always be assessed by a medical professional and may be a sign of an underlying illness 1 . When looking for the best products for dry skin, check the label for beneficial ingredients (like hyaluronic acid , glycerin, and niacinamide ) and seals of approval from reputable organizations (like the National Eczema Association). The American Academy of Dermatology AAD , for instance, recommends avoiding products that contain alcohol, fragrance, or harsh chemical exfoliants, as these may be irritating to dry skin or strip away natural oils. 2 This is one of many reasons all CeraVe products for dry skin are fragrance-free and developed with dermatologists . Formulated with three essential ceramides , they also help to lock in moisture and help maintain your skin’s protective barrier. Ceramides (pronounced “sair-uh-mydes”) are essential natural fatty components of human and animal skin, making up around 50% of its outer layer. They’re essential in helping to replenish and maintain your natural protective skin barrier, which helps keep moisture in and harmful elements out. 3 When there’s a lack of humidity in the air, the levels of ceramides in your skin become depleted, leading to dry skin and other issues. Plus, as we age, our natural production of ceramides slows down. Both of these factors can contribute to dry skin either seasonally or year-round. 3 This is why ceramides are such an effective ingredient in skincare products for dry skin, as well as for healthy-looking skin in general. In addition to skin-essential ceramides, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends looking f",
