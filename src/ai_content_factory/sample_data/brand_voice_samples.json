      "content": "Retinol gets a lot of hype—and for good reason. It's one of the few ingredients with decades of research backing its effectiveness for supporting healthy skin aging.\n\nBut here's what often gets lost: retinol works slowly. You won't see results in a week. Most people start noticing improvements around the 8-12 week mark.\n\nWhy the wait? Retinol works at the cellular level, encouraging cell turnover and supporting collagen production. That process takes time. Anyone promising overnight results is selling you something other than the truth.\n\nThe takeaway? Start slow (2-3 times per week), be patient with results, and always—always—wear SPF during the day. Retinol makes your skin more sun-sensitive, and sun damage will undo all the good work you're putting in.",

It's also stable and doesn't break down easily—meaning it actually makes it to your skin in active form.\n\nThe science: Niacinamide works by supporting your skin's production of ceramides and fatty acids, which are crucial for a healthy skin barrier. A strong barrier = better hydration, less irritation, healthier skin overall.\n\nBottom line: If you see niacinamide in our ingredient list, it's there for a reason—and your skin will thank you for it.",
