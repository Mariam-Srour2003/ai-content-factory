Here's the honest truth: purging is real, but it's not forever.\n\nPurging happens when active ingredients (like retinol or AHAs) speed up cell turnover, bringing underlying congestion to the surface faster. It typically clears within 4-6 weeks and happens only where you normally break out.\n\nBreaking out? That's irritation or a reaction to an ingredient your skin doesn't like. It appears in new areas and doesn't improve.\n\nThe difference matters. If you're unsure, give it two weeks and monitor closely. Your skin will tell you what it needs.",

    "content": "When products ball up on your skin, it's called pilling. Annoying, but fixable.\n\n**Why it happens:**\n• Silicones in different products clash\n• Too much product applied\n• Not waiting between layers\n• Dry skin creates friction\n• Incompatible formulations\n\n**The fixes:**\n1. Apply less product (seriously, less is more)\n2. Wait 60 seconds between each layer\n3. Apply on damp skin (reduces friction)\n4. Check for silicone conflicts\n5. Exfoliate regularly (removes dead cells that cause friction)\n\n**Prevention:**\nOur products are designed to layer well together. Pilling usually happens when mixing brands with different bases.\n\nIf you're using our full routine and still pilling, you're using too much. Scale back.",

Give it 4-6 weeks.\n\n**Q: Do I really need SPF indoors?**\nA: If you're near windows, yes. UVA penetrates glass. Otherwise, you can skip it.\n\n**Q: Can I skip moisturizer if I have oily skin?**\nA: No. Use lightweight, oil-free formulas. Oily skin still needs hydration.\n\nKeep the questions coming.

Results are modest.\n\n**Better approach:**\nSupport your body's natural collagen production:\n• Vitamin C (essential for collagen synthesis)\n• Retinoids (boost production)\n• Peptides (signal cells to make more)\n• SPF (prevent breakdown)\n• Adequate protein in diet\n\n**Bottom line:**\nSupplements might help slightly, but topical treatments and sun protection have stronger evidence.
